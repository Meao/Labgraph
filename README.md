## Description
The Labgraph repository, created by a 1st-grade student, contains code for creating and manipulating graphical representations of mathematical functions using MSDOS Borland Turbo C 2.01. This README provides an overview of the project and instructions for setting it up and running the code.

## Project Overview
The Labgraph project focuses on creating graphical representations of mathematical functions using the MSDOS Borland Turbo C 2.01 environment. It includes functionality to draw x and y axes, as well as specific functions such as quadratic functions, cycloid functions, cosine functions, and graphical shapes.

## Getting Started
To run the Labgraph project, follow these steps:
1. **Environment Setup**: Ensure that you have the MSDOS Borland Turbo C 2.01 environment set up on your system.
2. **Code Compilation**: Compile the provided source code files using the Turbo C compiler.
3. **Running the Program**: Execute the compiled program to visualize the graphical representations of mathematical functions.

## Code Structure
The project consists of the following files:
- **1.C**: Contains the main code for initializing the graphics driver, drawing x and y axes, and plotting the quadratic function f(x) = x^2.
- **2.C**: This file contains code for creating graphical shapes using pixel-based coordinates. It includes functions to draw 3D bars and filled ellipses.
- **3.C**: This file includes code for drawing a cycloid function, which involves initializing the graphics driver, setting up the graph space, and drawing the cycloid based on specified parameters.
- **4.C**: This file contains code for creating graphical shapes, including rectangles and circles, using pixel-based coordinates.
- **5.C**: This file includes code for drawing a cosine function, initializing the graphics driver, setting up the graph space, and plotting the cosine function based on specified parameters.
- **6.C**: This file contains code for creating a graphical pattern using rectangles.
- **GRAPHLAB.C**: Provides additional support for different X/Y axis scaling and fixes incorrect scaling. It includes functions for initializing the graphics driver, drawing x and y axes, and plotting quadratic and cycloid functions.
